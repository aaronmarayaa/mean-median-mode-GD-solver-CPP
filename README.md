This project solves for the value of mean, median, and mode of grouped data.
 
The actual file is the mean_median_mode_solver.cpp file that takes the number of sets of classes, then takes the lowest class value, and the highest class value. Then it will ask for frequencies; after that it will solve for the mean, median, and mode value.
 
The mean_median_mode.cpp is my first attempt of creating this solver, I use object-oriented-programming here,it doesnâ€™t ask for the number of sets of classes, and its capacity is 7 sets of classes only, and it fails to solve for the mean, median, and mode value.
 
My second attempt at creating this project is the meanMedianMode_GD.cpp file; it asks if you want to add one more class, but its minimum capacity is 2 and the maximum is 7. It solves for the value of mean, median, and mode; but, worse idea, I use 7 deep of if-else to fulfill this project.
 
Moreover, I create a file named test.cpp, to test computations, syntaxes, loops, functions etc.
I also create a reference file and program there the exact prototype of how the solver should work.
